<p>The Octocat is already out of the bag about GitHub.  The 10k new users/day growth is accelerating (below graphic and <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/122112-github-265318.html">link</a>), the <a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/07/09/social-network-for-developers-github-raises-monster-series-a-round-funding-100m/">$100mn from Andreesen Horowitz</a> likely makes it so they’ll never need outside funding again, and of course there’s the <a href="github.com/blog">over 5mn</a> repositories and counting – from jQuery to Rails to <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/06/cades-witty-headline-here/">writing academic books</a>, and so on.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.networkworld.com/graphics/2012/122112-GitHub-b.jpg" alt="Chart"></p>

<p>So why don’t we all just jump on the GitHub bandwagon? </p>

<p><strong>•   Competition makes everyone better.</strong></p>

<p>to GitHub.  Competition makes everyone continue to innovative and stay sharp.  Especially as it’s possible GitHub gets acquired or IPOs.  Good competition keeps everyone driving their best product to us users. </p>

<p><strong>•   Unlimited private repositories.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s face it.  There are times when you’re working on a new, cutting-edge project that you’re not ready to send into the world.  Code security.  Competitive advantage.  You don’t want everyone to know what you’re working on always.  Whatever your reason, Bitbucket provides FREE unlimited private repos. On the house. GRATIS.</p>

<p><strong>•   Double back-up.</strong></p>

<p>Last September GitHub went down twice in two days.  As GigaOm and the Twitter-sphere noted, that’s kind of a big deal – halting any number of 5mn projects is A LOT of projects – rendering any DVCS benefits irrevelant.  Given Bitbucket’s cost-effective pricing, and the new features that make syncing between the two easier than ever, this may even be a must.</p>

<p><strong>•   Preference for the BB user interface.</strong></p>

<p>This can come down to your own personal “style” and/or how enamored you are with Octocats.  Some people simply find Bitbucket’s color scheme and UI cleaner and easier on the eye, especially if you’re already spending countless hours in front of a screen, like so many of us are.  Ultimately, UI is an area where both services likely need to continue to improve.  That said, if you ‘can dig’ BB’s schema, and integration with the below, you may have found your match.</p>

<p><strong>•   Integration with JIRA and other great ‘DevOps’ tools (Confluence, Bamboo, etc)</strong></p>

<p>In a world where time is of the essence and dev workflow “zen” paramount, this final point shouldn’t be understated.  Sure, Jira also has good integration with GH.  Additional seamless integration with the SourceTree desktop client, Bamboo’s continuous integration, HipChat, and a steady stream of helpful content and tutorials might again, push some of us into the Bitbucket camp.</p>

<p>Or, at the very least illustrate [wc?] why there should ‘room at the inn’ for it in the emerging DVCS revolution [or as DVCS takes over the world].  </p>

<p>Wand to put the breaks on the ferocious pace of DVCS disruption? Just have everyone raise their white flag 
After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
