{"name":"Why there’s room for Bitbucket in a GitHub World","tagline":"","body":"The Octocat is already out of the bag for GitHub.  Their 10k new users/day growth is accelerating (below graphic and [link](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/122112-github-265318.html)), the [$100mn from Andreesen Horowitz](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/07/09/social-network-for-developers-github-raises-monster-series-a-round-funding-100m/) likely means that they’ll never need outside funding again, and of course there’s the [over 5mn](github.com/blog) repositories and counting – from jQuery to Rails to [writing academic books](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/06/cades-witty-headline-here/), and so on.\r\n\r\n![Chart](http://www.networkworld.com/graphics/2012/122112-GitHub-b.jpg)\r\n\r\nSo why don’t we all just jump on the GitHub bandwagon? \r\n\r\n**•\tCompetition makes everyone better.**\r\n\r\nWant to put the breaks on the ferocious pace of DVCS disruption?  Just have everyone raise their white flag to GitHub.  Competition makes everyone continue to innovative and [stay sharp](http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/186773/github-competition-growing-fast).  Especially [as it’s possible GitHub gets acquired](http://www.quora.com/GitHub/Why-is-GitHub-raising-funding) or IPOs.  Healthy competition keeps everyone driving their best product to us users. \r\n\r\n**•\tUnlimited private repositories.**\r\n\r\nLet’s face it.  There are times when you’re working on a new, cutting-edge project that you’re not ready to send into the world.  Code security.  Competitive advantage.  You don’t want everyone to know what you’re working on _always_.  Whatever your reason, Bitbucket provides FREE unlimited private repos. On the house. GRATIS.\r\n\r\n**•\tDouble back-up.**\r\n\r\nLast September GitHub [went down twice in two days](http://gigaom.com/2012/09/11/uh-oh-githubs-down/).  As GigaOm and the Twitter-sphere noted, that’s kind of a big deal – halting any number of 5mn projects is A LOT of projects – rendering any DVCS benefits irrevelant.  Given Bitbucket’s cost-effective pricing, and the new features that make [syncing between the two](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7658997/how-to-keep-two-git-repos-synchronized) easier than ever, doubling back-up may even be a _must do_ these days.\r\n\r\n**•\tPreference for the BB user interface.**\r\n\r\nPart of this can come down to your own personal “style” and/or how enamored you are with [Octocats](http://octodex.github.com/).  Yes they're cute, however, [some people] (http://blog.donovanglover.com/2013/02/bitbucket-vs-github/) simply find Bitbucket’s color scheme and UI cleaner and easier on the eye, especially if you’re already spending countless hours in front of a screen, like so many of us are.  Ultimately, UI is an area where both services likely need to continue to improve.  That said, if you ‘can dig’ BB’s schema, and integration with the below, you may have found your match.\r\n\r\n**•\tIntegration with JIRA and other great ‘DevOps’ tools**\r\n\r\nIn a world where time is of the essence and dev workflow “zen” paramount, this final point shouldn’t be understated.  Sure, Jira also has [good integration with GH] (https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-bitbucket-connector-plugin).  However, additional seamless integration with the [SourceTree] (http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [Bamboo’s continuous integration] (http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/overview), [HipChat] (https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/HipChat+Service+Management), and a steady stream of [helpful content] (http://www.atlassian.com/devops) and [tutorials] (http://www.atlassian.com/git) might push more of us into the Bitbucket camp.\r\n\r\n...or, at the very least demonstrates why there should be a place for Bitbucket in the emerging DVCS revolution.\r\n\r\n***\r\n_**Zach Jarvinen** curates DVCS culture, tools, and technology here and on twitter [@DVCS] (https://twitter.com/dvcs)._ ","google":"<script>   (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){   (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),   m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)   })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');    ga('create', 'UA-42340450-1', 'zachjarvinen.github.io');   ga('send', 'pageview');  </script>","note":"Don't delete this file!
